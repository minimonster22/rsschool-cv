## **About me**
![photo_2022-09-30_16-25-572.jpg](assets%2Fimg%2Fphoto_2022-09-30_16-25-572.jpg)

I love computers and everything connected with them. This is my main strength. I know how to reinstall Windows, find drivers and look for the causes of errors. I know how to ask chat-gpt questions correctly and find answers to my questions.

I have a little knowledge of html and css, but I'm trying to study it in more depth. Freelancing for 3 years worked as a content manager. Worked with different platforms WordPress, OpenCart, Bitrix. I have basic concepts about the structures of sites. I love getting new knowledge and that's why I'm studying at rs-school.
